# TODO need to extract data from all schemas that contain tables from postgres db hosted in neon
    # use python functions for now, each should translate to a task in the final dag (roughly)
    # for each schema, for each table in schema (extract)
    # use airflow hooks/operators instead of directly from postgres/snowflake connectors
